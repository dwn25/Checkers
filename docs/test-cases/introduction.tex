\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to outline the different methodologies that were
employed in order to evaluate the overall functionality of the Checkers game. The test cases
have been curated to satisfy the requirements outlined in the requirements document. Checkers 
is a game written in Rust modeled after a traditional game of Checkers where all rules and 
regulations are expected to be followed. The game is designed to be played between two players 
where these two players are connected over a local network and have the gameboard displayed to them 
graphically at their workstation.
