\section{Test Cases}
This document has been created in order to outline the methodologies that were employed in order to
 test the functionality and overall performance of the game of Checkers. These tests evaluate the current 
state of the program in accordance with the requirements stated in the requirements document. Checkers 
is an application that enables two users to play a traditional game of checkers over a local network. 
\subsection{Test Case 1: Initializing the Game}
\subsubsection{Description}
This test case outlines the steps necessary to launch and host a game of Checkers as well as the criteria 
specified for a succesful launch. 
\subsubsection{Pre-conditions necessary for the test case}
The two workstations must be connected over a local network. 
\subsubsection{Scenario}

\subsection{Test Case 2: Playing the Game}
\subsubsection{Description}
The test cases below outline the checks necessary to ensure legal moves are made and that
players are informed as to the status of the board (e.g capture of a piece, change of turn).
\subsubsection{Pre-conditions necessary for the test case}
The two workstations must be connected over a local network. A session should be active between these two 
workstations where a gameboard with pieces is displayed graphically to the two users in real time. 
\subsubsection{Scenario}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{1cm} |p{2cm}|p{2cm} |p{4cm}|p{4cm} |p{1.5cm}|  }\hline

  TestID & Requirement &Description & Execution Steps & Expected Results & Actual Results \\ \hline
  B1&5.1&Making a Move - Unpromoted Piece Success&Active player moves piece to available position in forward direction&Move data sent to server. Server validates move and sends updated board state to both players. GUI of players updates with board state.&\\ \hline
  B2&5.1&Making a Move - Promoted Piece Success&Active player moves piece to available position in either direction&Move data sent to server. Server validates move and sends updated board state to both players. GUI of players updates with board state.&\\ \hline
  B3&5.1&Making a Move - Failure&Active player moves piece to INVALID position&Move rejected on client-side and user is informed of invalid move&\\ \hline
  B4&5.2&Capturing a Piece - Unpromoted Piece Success&Active player makes required capture move by 'hopping' over enemy piece in forward direction to available square.&Move data sent to server. Server validates move and sends updated board state to both players. GUI of players updates with board state, removing captured pieces.&\\ \hline
  B5&5.2&Capturing a Piece - Promoted Piece Success&Active player makes required capture move by 'hopping' over enemy piece in either direction to available square.&Move data sent to server. Server validates move and sends updated board state to both players. GUI of players updates with board state, removing captured pieces.&\\ \hline
  B6&5.2&Capturing a Piece - Failure&Active player makes invalid capture or fails to capture&Client informes user of invalid move, failing locally& \\ \hline 
  B7&5.3&Promoting a Piece - Success&Active player makes valid unpromoted piece move to last row of board&Move data sent to and validated by server, new board state including the newly promoted piece sent to board players. GUI updated with promoted piece.& \\ \hline

\subsection{Test Case 3: Ending the Game}
\subsubsection{Description}
The following test cases outline conditions in which a game between two players may end by a win, resignation, or loss of connection to client/server.
\subsubsection{Pre-conditions necessary for the test case}
The two workstations must be connected over a local network. A session should be active between these two 
workstations where a gameboard with pieces is displayed graphically to the two users in real time. The game 
may be drawing to a close at this point. 
\subsubsection{Scenario}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{1cm} |p{2cm}|p{2cm} |p{4cm}|p{4cm} |p{1.5cm}|  }\hline

  TestID & Requirement &Description & Execution Steps & Expected Results & Actual Results \\ \hline
  C1&5.4&Game Complete by Win - Success&Active player captures last piece of opponent (one piece left on board)&Move sent to and validates by server. Server informs both players of completed game and ends the game. GUI updates with winner status and users are prompted to exit or play again.& \\ \hline
  C2&5.9&Game Complete by Resignation - Success&Active player clicks "Resign" button and confirms prompt.&Move data containing resignation is sent to and validated by server.Server informs both players of completed game and ends the game. GUI updates with winner status and users are prompted to exit or play again.& \\ \hline
  C3 & -- &Lost Connection - Failure&One client is closed or a connection is dropped.&The remaining client should recieve information about a disconnect and be prompted to exit.&\\ \hline
