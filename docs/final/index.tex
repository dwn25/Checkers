\section{Usage}
Building is handled via \href{https://www.docker.com/}{Docker} to provide a unified environment for building
without individual package management.

\subsection{Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Docker (\url{https://www.docker.com/get-started})
  \item Docker Compose (\url{https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/})
  \item GNU Make (\url{https://www.gnu.org/software/make/})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Make Targets}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
  \hline
  Target & Description  \\ \hline
  \texttt{all} & Format and run code  \\
  \texttt{fmt} & Format code according to official guidelines  \\
  \texttt{watch} & Watch source files and run tests on change  \\
  \texttt{lint} & Report linting warnings  \\
  \texttt{req-docs} & Generate requirements documentation  \\
  \texttt{test-docs} & Generate test case documentation  \\
  \texttt{final-docs} & Generate final documentation  \\
  \texttt{src-docs} & Generate and serve source documentation  \\
  \texttt{todos} & List stray TODO comments in the source  \\
  \texttt{cov} & Generate coverage report (with branches)*  \\
  \texttt{clean} & Remove generated files \\
  \hline
\end{tabularx}
* \textit{Coverage reporting currently requires a} \texttt{rust} \textit{nightly build
and other dependencies such as} \texttt{lcov}.

\subsection{Building}
Once the dependencies are installed, the game may be run inside a terminal with \texttt{make run}.

\section{Static Analysis}
The programming language Rust was chosen for development purposes in part due
to its in-built static analysis. With compiler implementations of concepts such
as borrow checking, lifetimes, and ownership, Rust attempts to guarantee memory
safety. By virtue of building without explicitly unsafe sections,
\textsc{Rusted Checkers} passes these static checks.

Extra linting analysis may be run with \texttt{make lint}. Any warnings
existing warnings from this command have been reviewed and allowed by the
developers.

\section{Release Notes}
This document outlines release notes for \texttt{v0.1.0} of \textsc{Rusted Checkers}.
\subsection{Working}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A game is created and a board is displayed within a terminal or TTY console.
  \item Piece capturing is implemented and displays a pieces as being captured.
  \item Possible moves are generated when an owned piece is clicked.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Not Implemented}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Networking, in full
  \item Piece promotion
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Known Issues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The main thread may panic on certain clicks that are unbounded by the
    board window.
\end{itemize}
